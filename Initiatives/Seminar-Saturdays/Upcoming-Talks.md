(#019) **Introduction to Differential Privacy** - [Kritika Prakash](https://kritikalcoder.github.io/)

**Date & Time:** [09-01-2021, 22:15 IST](https://www.google.com/calendar/event?eid=bG9idWRqYWVzMDJjMG5xaXBmdmF2aWR1OTJfMjAyMTAxMDlUMTY0NTAwWiB2bmw5c2RxN29vZmlwaWJobzEzMnIyZTAyNEBn&ctz=Asia/Kolkata)

### Abstract
This seminar will look into the need for computational privacy, the basics of differential privacy, and how it is used to analyze data. Differential privacy is a system for publicly sharing information about a dataset by describing the patterns of groups within the dataset while withholding information about individuals in the dataset. Differentially private mechanisms can make confidential data widely available for accurate data analysis. Differential Privacy provides us with a mathematical guarantee on the upper bound of privacy loss, for any query. It is a very recent sub-field of cryptography, and is being deployed in real-world companies such as Google and Apple. It is a thriving research area and has applications in Machine Learning.

### Prerequisites
Basic understanding of algorithms and probability.

**Date & Time:** [23-01-2021, 22:15 IST](https://www.google.com/calendar/event?eid=bG9idWRqYWVzMDJjMG5xaXBmdmF2aWR1OTJfMjAyMTAxMjNUMTY0NTAwWiB2bmw5c2RxN29vZmlwaWJobzEzMnIyZTAyNEBn&ctz=Asia/Kolkata)

### Abstract
In distributed storage systems, data is usually stored in a distributed fashion in several nodes with some replications. This is done so that the data is reliably maintained and is easy available for multiple clients. In such systems, nodes can fail or can be added, because of which the replication factor changes. This phenomenon is called Data Skew. The goal is to correct this Data Skew and reinstate the replication factor. This involves communication between nodes and thus incurs a cost. Coded Communication (communication of linear combinations of data symbols) has the potential to reduce this communication load by a multiplicative factor. In this talk, we will also see how we can preserve the essential structure of how the data is stored in the system.
