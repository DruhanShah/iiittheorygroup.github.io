<details><summary>May 22 2021<b>|</b> (#029) <b>Approximate Computing</b> - <a href="salman.ahmed@research.iiit.ac.in"> Salman Ahmed </a></summary><div class="custom-spoiler"><p>

**Date and Time**: [08-05-2021, 20:00 - 21:00 IST]()

### Abstract
Approximate Computing is used to exploit error resilience of the application to optimise hardware architectures. I will discuss some techniques on approximation and how it can improve underlying designs. Next how approximate computing is automated and scaled over for existing chip design flows. Next I will go over some tricks in improving test of such circuits and finally discuss the insecurity aspects of approximate computing and lastly suggest some directions of future research.

### Prerequisites
Brief knowledge on hardware design and some Boolean algebra, signal processing basics, test and security of circuits.

Even if you don't know these, the hardware points will be made simple enogh for anyone to understand. The focus will be mostly on algorithms so even someone with only a CS background can understand.
