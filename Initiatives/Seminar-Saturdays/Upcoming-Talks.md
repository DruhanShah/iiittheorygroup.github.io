### (#020) BitcoinF: Achieving Fairness for Bitcoin in Transaction-Fee-Only Model - [Ganesh Vanahalli](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=o7lihv0L59cC&hl=en)

**Date & Time:** [16-01-2021, 22:15 IST](https://www.google.com/calendar/event?eid=bG9idWRqYWVzMDJjMG5xaXBmdmF2aWR1OTJfMjAyMTAxMTZUMTY0NTAwWiB2bmw5c2RxN29vZmlwaWJobzEzMnIyZTAyNEBn&ctz=Asia/Kolkata)

### Abstract
Bitcoin is the most known and successful (terms of market cap) cryptocurrency out there. Bitcoin is currently able to achieve its intended objectives through incentivising the process of mining by providing something known as a Block Reward. To control inflation of the Bitcoin, Block Reward is halved after the discovery of every 210,000 blocks. In this talk we discuss the problems that arise when (in near future) the block reward is negligible and also provide a possible solution to tackle such issues.

### Prerequisites
Basics of cryptography: Hashing, Digital Signatures.

**Date & Time:** [23-01-2021, 22:15 IST](https://www.google.com/calendar/event?eid=bG9idWRqYWVzMDJjMG5xaXBmdmF2aWR1OTJfMjAyMTAxMjNUMTY0NTAwWiB2bmw5c2RxN29vZmlwaWJobzEzMnIyZTAyNEBn&ctz=Asia/Kolkata)

### Abstract
In distributed storage systems, data is usually stored in a distributed fashion in several nodes with some replications. This is done so that the data is reliably maintained and is easy available for multiple clients. In such systems, nodes can fail or can be added, because of which the replication factor changes. This phenomenon is called Data Skew. The goal is to correct this Data Skew and reinstate the replication factor. This involves communication between nodes and thus incurs a cost. Coded Communication (communication of linear combinations of data symbols) has the potential to reduce this communication load by a multiplicative factor. In this talk, we will also see how we can preserve the essential structure of how the data is stored in the system.
