Seminar Saturdays
=================

An initiative where students present something of their choice every alternate week. It could be a research paper/topic/field/concept etc. A short 30-60 minute presentation, followed by an audience interaction.

Usually hosted on Zoom or Discord. If the speaker and audience permit, talks are recorded and uploaded to our YouTube channel too.

Vision
------

The seminars were initially started as a way to share ideas and learn theory together. We hosted talks on various topics given by current students. With time, we shifted the focus to research seminars. Research students in different fields would come and talk about their line of work, open problems and how it is in general.

We are looking for active researchers (both current students and alumni) to come and give talks, and share their knowledge and experience with young aspiring researchers. If you are interested or know someone who is, please [hit us up](Seminar-Saturdays/Give-A-Talk)!
