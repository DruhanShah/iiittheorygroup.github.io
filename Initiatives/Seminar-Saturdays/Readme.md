Seminar Saturdays
=================

An initiative where one student presents something of their choice every week. It could be a research paper/topic/field/concept etc. A short 30-60 minute presentation, followed by a Q/A session.

Usually hosted on Zoom or Discord. If the speaker and audience permit, talks are recorded and uploaded to our YouTube channel too.
