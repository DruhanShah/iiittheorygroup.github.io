**Date & Time:** [16-01-2021, 22:15 IST](https://www.google.com/calendar/event?eid=bG9idWRqYWVzMDJjMG5xaXBmdmF2aWR1OTJfMjAyMTAxMTZUMTY0NTAwWiB2bmw5c2RxN29vZmlwaWJobzEzMnIyZTAyNEBn&ctz=Asia/Kolkata)

### Abstract
Bitcoin is the most known and successful (terms of market cap) cryptocurrency out there. Bitcoin is currently able to achieve its intended objectives through incentivising the process of mining by providing something known as a Block Reward. To control inflation of the Bitcoin, Block Reward is halved after the discovery of every 210,000 blocks. In this talk we discuss the problems that arise when (in near future) the block reward is negligible and also provide a possible solution to tackle such issues.

### Prerequisites
