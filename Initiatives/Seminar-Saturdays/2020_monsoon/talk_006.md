(#006) **Automated Theorem Proving** - [Anurudh Peduri](https://github.com/anurudhp)
-----

**Date & Time:** 26-09-2020, 22:15 IST

### Abstract
An introduction to Proof Assistants, and how automated theorem proving actually works. We will see how to formally specify math propositions and proofs to a computer so that they can be verified.

### Prerequisites
None! Just basic high school math.

### Resources
[Coq](https://coq.inria.fr/) and [Lean](https://leanprover.github.io/) theorem provers.
There are other [proof assistants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_assistant) too.
