(#013) **Introduction to Quantum Chemistry** - [Tanuj Khattar](https://in.linkedin.com/in/tanuj-khattar-8b3042124)
--------------------

**Date & Time:** 15-11-2020, 22:40 IST

### Abstract
This talk aims to introduce computer science students to the field of Quantum Chemistry. We will start by introducing the electronic structure problem and gradually show how we can solve for dissociation energy of H2 molecule via a quantum circuit using OpenFermion.

### Prerequisites
Basics of Quantum Computing,  Basics of electronic structure theory (Class 11th NCERT), Basic python.
