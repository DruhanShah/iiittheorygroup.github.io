(#012) **Fuzzy Set Theory** - [Jayitha Reddy](https://jayitha.github.io/)
--------------------

**Date & Time:** 07-11-2020, 22:15 IST

### Abstract
Around the 1960s there was a grand paradigm shift in Science, challenging the traditional view which insisted that uncertainity was undesirable and should be avoided. This shift brought upon a modern view which is tolerant of uncertainity and insists that science cannot avoid it. Fuzzy set theory is a result of this shift, it challenges the very foundations upon which probability theory is based on: Aristotelian two-valued logic. In this seminar I will briefly introduce concepts of Fuzzy Set Theory: definitions, types and operators.

### Prerequisites
Elementary Set Theory (not necessary though).

### Resources
_Fuzzy Sets and Fuzzy Logic: Theory and Applications by George Klir_
