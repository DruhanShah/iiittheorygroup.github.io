(#014) **Introduction to Special Relativity** - [Aditya Bharti](https://github.com/adbugger)
-----------------------------

**Date & Time:** 21-11-2020, 22:30 IST

### Abstract
No forces, no gravity, no accelerations, just cruising along in free space with Taylor and Wheeler as our guides. Our aim is to show that physics is plenty complicated without gravity in the mix. Just accept what Maxwell tells us about light and go from there.

### Prerequisites
- 12th grade math - Vectors and Calculus
- Understanding what is meant by a coordinate frame (optional)
- Understanding what is meant by a coordinate transformation (optional)

### References
Spacetime Physics - Introduction to Special Relativity - Taylor & Wheeler. The talk will roughly be the first 2-3 chapters of this book.
