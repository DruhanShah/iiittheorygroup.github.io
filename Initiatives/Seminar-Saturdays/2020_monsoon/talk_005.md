(#005) **Origami âˆ© Math** - [Athreya C](https://cathreya.github.io/)
-----------------

**Date & Time:** 19-09-2020, 22:15 IST

### Abstract
Will approach the problem of Origami design from a math persepective. I will try to motivate why this is important, and then try to give some insight into how the techniques behind modern Origami design were developed by giving some key moments in its history. Finally I will describe one of the most powerful and generalizable techniques to design Origami.

Most of my talk will be directly from material in Origami Design Secrets, 2nd Edition by Robert J. Lang
