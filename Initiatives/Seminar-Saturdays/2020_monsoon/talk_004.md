(#004) **Spectral Graph Theory** - [Tanmay Kumar Sinha](https://github.com/Tanmay-Kumar-Sinha)
----------------

**Date & Time:** 12-09-2020, 21:00 IST

### Abstract
I will be covering introductory material on spectral graph theory(defining the matrices associated to a graph, some properties of these matrices, and then some graph theory problems that can be solved using linear algebraic methods)

### Prerequisites
Basic linear algebra and graph theory

### Resources
The main resource will be 1st and possibly 2nd chapter of the book [Spectra of Graphs, by Brouwer and Haemers](https://www.win.tue.nl/~aeb/2WF02/spectra.pdf).
Another good resource is [(Chap. 4) Introduction to Spectral Graph Theory](http://users.cms.caltech.edu/~vidick/notes/CMS139/spectral.pdf)
