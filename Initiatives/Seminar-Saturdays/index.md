Seminar Saturdays
=================

An initiative where one student presents something of their choice every week. It could be a research paper/topic/field/concept etc. A short 30-45 minute presentation, followed by a Q/A session.

Usually hosted on Zoom or Discord. If the speaker and audience permit, talks are recorded and uploaded to our YouTube channel too.

(#012) <b>Fuzzy Set Theory</b> - Jayitha Reddy

**Date & Time:** 07-11-2020, 22:15 IST

### Abstract
Around the 1960s there was a grand paradigm shift in Science, challenging the traditional view which insisted that uncertainity was undesirable and should be avoided. This shift brought upon a modern view which is tolerant of uncertainity and insists that science cannot avoid it. Fuzzy set theory is a result of this shift, it challenges the very foundations upon which probability theory is based on: Aristotelian two-valued logic. In this seminar I will briefly introduce concepts of Fuzzy Set Theory: definitions, types and operators.

### Prerequisites
Elementary Set Theory (not necessary though). 

### Resources

<details><summary>(#011) <b>Convex Optimizations</b> - Arpan Dasgupta, Abhishek Mittal</summary><p>

**Date & Time:** 31-10-2020, 22:15 IST

### Abstract
"Mathematics can instruct us on how to optimise a given problem, but the challenging part is figuring out what to optimize." There are multiple algorithms out there to find the optimal solution to a problem, some are fully developed and some are active research areas. Whereas most of these algorithms are only able to efficiently find a solution if your objective function is convex, most of the real life optimisation problems are not so straightforwardly convex. We will discuss what these convex functions are and how we can try to convert our objective functions (that we want to minimise or maximise) in real life to convex functions so that we can use our traditional algorithms to find a solution. We will show with the help of a problem how lower bounds can be attained on a real life applicable problem.

### Prerequisites 
Linear Algebra - Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors, Positive Semidefiniteness.

<details><summary>(#009) <b>A Tour On Optimization Methods</b> - Jayadev Naram</summary><p>

**Date & Time:** 17-10-2020, 22:15 IST

### Abstract
An optimization method solves the problem of finding the minimizer of a function in a given search space. There are a wide variety of optimization algorithms used in applications. But to guarantee global or even local optimality one needs the problem to satisfy some set of conditions. Usually, the function considered will be differentiable upto the 2nd order. For these types of problems there is a rich class of optimization methods which are provably optimal. This class of algorithms is broadly classified into - Line Search Methods and Trust Region Methods. This talk gives an overview of these classes of optimization algorithms along with a brief discussion of convergence results.

### Prerequisites

<details><summary>(#008) <b>p-adics</b> - Siddharth Bhat</summary><p>
  
**Date & Time:** 10-10-2020, 23:00 IST
  
### Abstract 
The integers and polynomials of a single variable look tantalizingly similar. Many of our intuitions about factorizations, primality, GCD, LCM, and other number-theoretic operations work "equally well" on  single-variable polynomials. 

However, single-variable polynomials appear to provide a richer theory at first glance:  We can evaluate polynomials, differentiate them, take their taylor series expansion, and other operations which are hinged on the ability to interpret a polynomial as a function. We shall embark on a quest to port these operations back into number-land. This will lead us to eventually define the p-adics, which can be viewed as the "correct way" to transport the ability to evaluate a single-variable polynomial back into the integers. 

Some cute counter intuitive results will be shown. Delight shall hopefully be had. No theorems of consequence will be  demonstrated, since my knowledge of these p-adics is limited.

### Resources
The reference material for the talk is the first three to four chapters of the book, "p-adic numbers, an introduction" by Fernando Gouvea: https://www.springer.com/us/book/9783642590580

<details><summary>(#007) <b>Two proofs in the margin</b> - Bharathi Ramana Joshi</summary><p>

**Date & Time:** 03-10-2020, 22:15 IST

### Abstract
Hailed as the queen of mathematics, number theory is one of the most accessible, yet most abstract areas of mathematics. Fermat's Last Theorem, which states that there are no positive integers a, b, c such that a^n + b^n = c^n  for any integer value of n > 2, remaind unsolved for 358 years and is the theorem with the largest number of unsuccessful proofs. Although the proof for any n uses heavy machinery from algebraic number theory (indeed, the conjecture drove the development of much of it), the proof for the special case n=4 uses a technique named infinite descent and is accessible. This talk demonstrates application of infinite descent to the n=4 case and two proofs for the same.

### Prerequisites
Highschool level understanding of number theory; specifically GCD, pythagorean triples and modular arithmetic (congruence mod n relation).

### Resources
None! Just come and enjoy the show

### Prerequisites

<details><summary>(#003) <b>Randomized Algorithms, the Probabilistic Method and Derandomization through the lens of 3SAT</b> - Arjun P</summary><p>

**Date & Time:** 05-09-2020, 21:00 IST

### Abstract
We'll look at a trivial-looking randomized approximation algorithm for MAX-E3SAT, the problem of satisfying as many clauses as possible in a special kind of 3SAT instance. We'll then introduce the probabilistic method and see how it can use our algorithm to say something about the satisfiability of arbitrary E3SAT instances. Finally, we will discuss how one could obtain a deterministic approximation algorithm for the same problem.

### Prerequisites
Basic probability and expectations, linearity of expectations, conditional expectation. Knowing what 3SAT and NP-Completeness are would be required to appreciate the significance, but not necessarily to follow the discussion [For the latter, consult any textbook on complexity theory, e.g., Arora-Barak]

### Resources
This slideshow (page 7 & 8) are most of the content of the talk: https://cse.buffalo.edu/~hungngo/classes/2008/694/notes/rr-sat.pdf. From a quick google, I couldn't find anything that talks about it in more detail for this particular problem, but the ideas are the same. This technique for derandomization is called the method of conditional expectations.

For more on the probabilistic method, you can see the textbook titled (surprise!) the Probabilistic Method by Alon & Spencer.
