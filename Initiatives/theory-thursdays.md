Theory Thursdays!
=================

Hey everyone! We usually meet every other Thursday, to discuss and share what cool stuff we've learnt/come across/found interesting in the last week, and just hang out. There is no restriction on what it should be. Everyone is free to share (and teach) anything and whatever they've come across that they think is cool and want to share with the others. 

Warning: Can sometimes extend well into the next morning :D

To start off the discussion we usually have 2 volunteers who kickstart the discussion. The primary topics discussed in the previous sessions are logged below.
