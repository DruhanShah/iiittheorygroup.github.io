About the IIIT Theory Group
===========================

Welcome!
========
Welcome to our group! We are just a bunch of people who are fascinated about science and technology, and want to learn the theoretical roots behind it.
Our primary mode of discussions is the Discord Server. Ask a moderator or a batchmate for an invite!

We started out as a small group, consisting of about 10 people who explored a couple of topics in weekly meets. Within a few years the group expanded and now we have over 50 active members and 150 verified users! At first glance the server might seem too daunting, but fear not! We are all very welcoming people who are more than happy to have more theory enthusiasts join us in our pursuit of knowledge and understanding! 

Getting Started
===============
If you are new to the server, here are a few things to try out:
- Introduce yourself in the `#welcome` channel. We will be glad to learn more about you and your interests.
- Attend our next Theory Thursday session. They are just casual meetups (online/offline) for the members of the group. People usually talk about all sorts of things, and they are a ton of fun.
- Join a live chat VC and just hang out with others. Just for fun. You can do work together, or just talk about life.
- Try out the `#problem-of-the-week` and discuss it with others.
- Check out our other initatives down in the *Initiatives* category.
- If something catches your interest, you can always discuss it in `#random-discussions`. You can also bring up any topic you have in mind.
- Check our our amazing memes in `#memes-and-jokes`. Feel free to post there too xD

Initiatives
===========
There are numerous active initiatives on the group, and we are always open for more ideas!

Theory Thursdays
----------------
We usually meet every Thursday, to discuss and share what cool stuff we've learnt/come across/found interesting in the last week, and just hang out. There is no restriction on what it should be. Feel free to share anything.

[Seminar Saturdays](Initiatives/Seminar-Saturdays)
-----------------
An initiative to have regular presentations on various topics, delivered by different students. The primary goal is to learn or be aware different topics and fields, at least at a surface level.

If you want to present a topic, please let us know in the `#seminar-saturdays`. We'll try to schedule as many talks as possible (but only one in a week).
The talk must be 30-60 minutes long, and the presenter can take questions after it is done. Please stick to a rigid time plan for the talk, to prevent it from becoming too long.
Post the title + abstract and resources for the talk 3 days in advance (on the previous Wednesday), and mention the prerequisites.

Problem of the Week (PotW)
--------------------------
Problem solving is a nice way for people to discuss and learn theory. This initiative is to have regular problem solving, and encouraging everyone to discuss after they've attempted the solution.

A problem will be posted in `#problem-of-the-week` on Saturday every week. And you'll be free to discuss it in the chat in `#potw-discussions` the Friday after it's posted. Everyone is also free to discuss older problems there (in case they didn't have time in a week to attempt it etc.)

Note that the aim isn't to take a very difficult problem and solve it. It might be a very simple problem, but having an elegant solution, or emphasizing on a particular concept in a unique, interesting way.
