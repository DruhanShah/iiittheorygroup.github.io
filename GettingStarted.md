Getting Started
===============
If you are new to the server, here are a few things to try out:
- Attend our next Theory Thursday session. They are just casual meetups (online/offline) for the members of the group. People usually talk about all sorts of things, and they are a ton of fun.
- Join a live chat VC and just hang out with others. Just for fun. You can do work together, or just talk about life.
- Check out our other initatives down in the *Initiatives* category.
- If something catches your interest, you can always discuss it in `#random-discussions`. You can also bring up any topic you have in mind.
- Check our our amazing memes in `#memes-and-jokes`. Feel free to post there too xD
